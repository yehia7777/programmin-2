"""
A Class in Python has three types of access modifiers:
    
    Public Access Modifier
    Protected Access Modifier
    Private Access Modifier
"""



"""
Public Access Modifier: 
    
    All data members and member functions of a class are public by default. 
"""

# class Person(object):

#  	# __init__ is known as the constructor
#  	def __init__(self, name, idnumber):
#          self.name = name
#          self.idnumber = idnumber

#  	def display(self):
#          print(self.name)
#          print(self.idnumber)



# obj = Person("Khalid", 257853)

# # accessing public data member
# print("Name: ", obj.name)
# print("Id: ", obj.idnumber)


# # calling public member function of the class
# obj.display()


"""
Protected Access Modifier:
    The members of a class that are declared protected are only accessible to a class derived 
    from it. Data members of a class are declared protected by adding a single underscore ‘_’ 
"""

# program to illustrate protected access modifier in a class

# super class
# class Student:
# 	
# 	# protected data members
# 	_name = None
# 	_roll = None
# 	_branch = None
# 	
# 	# constructor
# 	def __init__(self, name, roll, branch): 
# 		self._name = name
# 		self._roll = roll
# 		self._branch = branch
# 	
# 	# protected member function 
# 	def _displayRollAndBranch(self):

# 		# accessing protected data members
# 		print("Roll: ", self._roll)
# 		print("Branch: ", self._branch)


# # derived class
# class Geek(Student):

# 	# constructor 
# 	def __init__(self, name, roll, branch): 
#          Student.__init__(self, name, roll, branch) 
# 		
# 	# public member function 
# 	def displayDetails(self):
#          # accessing protected data members of super class 
#          print("Name: ", self._name) 
# 		 # accessing protected member functions of super class 
#          self._displayRollAndBranch()

# # creating objects of the derived class	 
# obj = Geek("Ali", 1706256, "Information Technology") 

# # calling public member functions of the class
# obj.displayDetails() 





"""
Private Access Modifier:
    The members of a class that are declared private are accessible within the class only, 
    Data members of a class are declared private by adding a double underscore ‘__’
"""

# program to illustrate private access modifier in a class

class Geek:
	
	# private members
	__name = None
	__roll = None
	__branch = None

	# constructor
	def __init__(self, name, roll, branch): 
		self.__name = name
		self.__roll = roll
		self.__branch = branch

	# private member function 
	def __displayDetails(self):
		# accessing private data members
		print("Name: ", self.__name)
		print("Roll: ", self.__roll)
		print("Branch: ", self.__branch)
	
	# public member function

	# getter method for name
	def get_name(self):

	# setter method name
	def set_name(self , name):
		self.__name = name 

	# getter method for roll
	def get_roll(self):
		self.__roll
        
	# setter method roll
	def set_roll(self , roll):

	# getter method for branch
	def get_branch(self):
		self.__branch
        
	# setter method branch
	def set_branch(self , branch):
		self.__branch = branch 

             
# creating object 
obj = Geek("Osama", 1706256, "Information Technology")
